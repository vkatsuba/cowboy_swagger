## Contact Us

If you find any **bugs** or have a **problem** while using this library, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy_swagger/issues/new) in this repo
(or a pull request :)).

## Why Cowboy Swagger?

Simple, because there isn't a tool in Erlang to document Cowboy RESTful APIs easy and fast,
and to improve development productivity.

With `cowboy_swagger` is possible to integrate Swagger to your Erlang projects that use Cowboy as a web server.
It is extremely easy to use, and with just a few steps you'll have a nice Web documentation for your RESTful APIs.

To learn a bit more about Swagger, please check this [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20161110235900/https://inaka.net/blog/2015/06/23/erlang-swagger-2015/).

## How to Use it?

This is the best part. It is extremely easy.

### 1. Document each Cowboy Handler

Because `cowboy_swagger` runs on top of `trails`, the first thing that you have to do
is document all about your handler within the trails metadata. Keep in mind that
all fields defined within each method into the metadata must be compliant with the
[Swagger specification](https://swagger.io/specification).

For example, suppose that you have `example_echo_handler`, so it must implement the
`c:trails_handler:trails/0` callback:

```erlang
trails() ->
  Metadata =
    #{get =>
      #{tags => ["echo"],
        description => "Gets echo var from the server",
        produces => ["text/plain"]
      },
      put =>
      #{tags => ["echo"],
        description => "Sets echo var in the server",
        produces => ["text/plain"],
        parameters => [
          #{name => <<"echo">>,
            description => <<"Echo message">>,
            in => <<"path">>,
            required => false,
            type => <<"string">>}
        ]
      }
    },
  [trails:trail("/message/[:echo]", example_echo_handler, [], Metadata)].
```

To get a better idea of how your handler should look like, please check [`example/src/example_echo_handler.erl`](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy_swagger/blob/master/example/src/example_echo_handler.erl).

### 2. Include cowboy_swagger in your app

First, you need to include `cowboy_swagger_handler` module in your list of trails to be compiled.

```erlang
% Include cowboy_swagger_handler in the trails list
Trails = trails:trails([example_echo_handler,
                        example_description_handler,
                        cowboy_swagger_handler]),
% store them
trails:store(Trails),
% and then compile them
Dispatch = trails:single_host_compile(Trails),
```

The snippet of code above is usually placed when you start `cowboy`. Check it [here](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy_swagger/blob/master/example/src/example.erl).

Then add `cowboy_swagger` to the list of apps to be loaded in your `*.app.src` file.

```erlang
{application, example,
 [
  {description, "Cowboy Swagger Basic Example."},
  {vsn, "0.1"},
  {applications,
   [kernel,
    stdlib,
    jsx,
    cowboy,
    trails,
    cowboy_swagger
   ]},
  {modules, []},
  {mod, {example, []}},
  {registered, []},
  {start_phases, [{start_trails_http, []}]}
 ]
}.
```

And that's it, you got it. Now start your application and then you will have access to the API docs
under the path `/api-docs`. Supposing that you're running the app on `localhost:8080`,
that will be [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs).

## Configuration

Additionally, `cowboy_swagger` can be configured/customized from a `*.config` file:

### app.config

```erlang
[
 %% Other apps ...

 %% cowboy_swagger config
 {cowboy_swagger,
  [
   %% `path`: Path where you can access Swagger-UI. Default: `/api-docs`
   {path, "/api-docs-swagger"},
   %% `static_files`: Static content directory. This is where Swagger-UI
   %% is located. Default: `priv/swagger`.
   %% Remember that Swagger-UI is embedded into `cowboy-swagger` project,
   %% within `priv/swagger` folder. BUT you have to reference that path,
   %% and depending on how you're using `cowboy-swagger` it will be different.
   %% For example, assuming that you want to run your app which has
   %% `cowboy-swagger` as dependency from the console, `static_files` will be:
   {static_files, "./deps/cowboy_swagger/priv/swagger"},

   %% `global_spec`: Global fields for Swagger specification.
   %% If these fields are not set, `cowboy_swagger` will set default values.
   {global_spec,
    #{swagger => "2.0",
      info => #{title => "Example API"},
      %% See "path" config section
      basePath => "/api-docs-swagger"
     }
   }
  ]
 }
].
```

### Definitions

[Definitions](https://swagger.io/specification/#definitionsObject) can be used for describing
[parameters](https://swagger.io/specification/#parametersDefinitionsObject),
[responses](https://swagger.io/specification/#responsesDefinitionsObject) and
[security](https://swagger.io/specification/#securityDefinitionsObject) schemas.

For adding definitions to your app, you have 2 choices:

1. Add a `definitions` key to your cowboy_swagger `global_spec` map.
2. Add them by calling `cowboy_swagger:add_definition/2` and send the
   definition's name and properties.

Let's say you want to describe a `POST` call to a `newspapers` endpoint that requires
`name` and `description` fields only, you can do it like this:

**Option 1:**

```erlang
[ ... % other configurations
, { cowboy_swagger
  , [ { global_spec
      , #{ swagger => "2.0"
         , info => #{title => "My app API"}
         , definitions => #{
             "RequestBody" =>
               #{ "name" =>
                   #{ "type" => "string"
                    , "description" => "Newspaper name"
                    }
                , "description" =>
                    #{ "type" => "string"
                     , "description" => "Newspaper description"
                     }
                }
           }
         }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Option 2:**

For the second choice, you can do it for example in one or several `start_phases`,
directly in your handler or any other place you want.

```erlang
-spec trails() -> trails:trails().
trails() ->
  DefinitionName = <<"RequestBody">>,
  DefinitionProperties =
    #{ <<"name">> =>
         #{ type => <<"string">>
          , description => <<"Newspaper name">>
          }
     , <<"description">> =>
         #{ type => <<"string">>
          , description => <<"Newspaper description">>
          }
     },
  % Add the definition
  ok = cowboy_swagger:add_definition(DefinitionName, DefinitionProperties),
  ...
```

Now in your handler's trails callback function you can use it:

```erlang
...
  RequestBody =
    #{ name => <<"request body">>
     , in => body
     , description => <<"request body (as json)">>
     , required => true
       % Use the previously created `RequestBody' definition
     , schema => cowboy_swagger:schema(<<"RequestBody">>)
     },
  Metadata =
    #{ get =>
       #{ tags => ["newspapers"]
        , description => "Returns the list of newspapers"
        , produces => ["application/json"]
        }
     , post =>
       # { tags => ["newspapers"]
         , description => "Creates a new newspaper"
         , consumes => ["application/json"]
         , produces => ["application/json"]
         , parameters => [RequestBody] % and then use that parameter here
         }
     },
  Path = "/newspapers",
  Options = #{path => Path},
  [trails:trail(Path, newspapers_handler, Options, Metadata)].
```

What this does for you is add a nice `response`, `parameter` or `security`
model in swagger-ui, so client developers will know exactly what parameters
the API expects for every endpoint.
